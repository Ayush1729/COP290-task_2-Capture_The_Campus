Status of the game:
The game is working as we have envisioned it. All the controls, I/Os, sound effects and visuals are working fine.  
We were only not able to implement the multiplayer part of the game as it should be. We were facing problems connecting the server and client-side code over a network and send/receive data packets using socket programming. We tried to connect it over different networks, but the problem persisted. Therefore, we used the loopback IPAddress to play the game on a single device with two-game windows. Both players will play the game on the same desktop, and each player has to select their moves one by one.
